## Title
L1 - Create a Number Pyramid with Break and Continue


## Problem Statement
Write a program that prints a pyramid of numbers, but with the following twist:

- Use a nested `for` loop to generate the pyramid.
- The number of rows in the pyramid should be based on user input (between 1 and 10).
- Skip printing numbers that are divisible by 3 using the `continue` statement.
- Stop the pyramid when you reach a row that contains a number divisible by 7 using the `break` statement.

## Example of input/output:

### Input Example:

```
Enter number of rows (1-10): 5
```
### Output Example:
```
1
1 2
1 2
1 2 4
1 2 4 5
```
In this example, the loop skips the numbers divisible by 3 and stops once a row contains a number divisible by 7.
