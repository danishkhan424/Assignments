## Title:

Fetch and Display Products with Error Handling

---

## Problem Statement:

Create a product listing page that fetches data from the FakeStoreAPI ([https://fakestoreapi.com/products](https://fakestoreapi.com/products)) and displays the product details in a grid format. Each product should show its image, title, price, and a button labeled "View Details". If the API call fails (e.g., an incorrect URL is used), display a user-friendly error message.

---

## Key Requirements:

* Fetch data from the API using the Fetch API and display the products dynamically.
* Implement error handling to display a message like "Failed to fetch products. Please try again later" when the API call fails.
* Use a try-catch block to handle errors with async/await.
