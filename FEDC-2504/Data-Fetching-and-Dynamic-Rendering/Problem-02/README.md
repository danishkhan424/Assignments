# Q: 2

## Title:

Create a New Post

---

## Problem Statement:

Build a form with fields for Title and Body. When the form is submitted, send the data as a POST request to the JSONPlaceholder API ([https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)). Display the server's response, including the newly created post ID, below the form.

---

## Key Requirements:

* Use the Fetch API to send the form data as JSON in the request body.
* Display the response from the server (post ID, title, and body) dynamically on the page.
* Ensure form validation: both fields must be non-empty before submission.
