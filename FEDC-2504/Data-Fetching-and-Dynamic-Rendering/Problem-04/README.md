# Q: 4

## Title:

Weather Application

---

## Task Description:

You are tasked with creating a simple weather application that fetches data dynamically from the OpenWeatherMap API ([https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather](https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather)) and displays it on a web page. Your application should:

* Use the Fetch API, Promises, or async/await to retrieve weather data based on the city entered by the user.
* Display the fetched data dynamically within the web page. For example, show information like temperature, humidity, and a brief weather description.
* Handle errors gracefully, such as when an invalid city name is entered or if the network request fails.

---

## Additional Requirements:

* The user must be able to enter the name of a city into a form.
* On submitting the form, the weather data should appear on the page dynamically without refreshing it.
* Apply basic styling to ensure the interface is user-friendly and visually appealing.

---

## Bonus Challenge:

* Include the weather icon provided by the API in the output.
* Add a loading spinner or a message while fetching data to enhance user experience.
