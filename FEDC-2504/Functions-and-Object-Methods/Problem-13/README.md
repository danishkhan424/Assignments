# L1 - Sum of Multiple Numbers (Using Rest Parameters)

## Problem Statement:
Write a function called `sumNumbers` that prompts the user to enter a series of numbers (one at a time using `prompt()`). After each prompt, the function should check if the user has entered a valid number. If not, prompt them again until they provide valid numbers.

The function should then use rest parameters to sum up all the valid numbers and return the total.

### Example Scenario:
The user enters 5, 10, and 15.
The function returns 30.

### Requirements:
- Use a loop to collect the numbers.
- Use the `sumNumbers(...args)` function to calculate the sum of the numbers using rest parameters.
