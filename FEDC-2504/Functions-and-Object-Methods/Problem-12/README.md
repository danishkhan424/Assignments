# L0 - Greet User With Prompt Input

## Problem Statement:
Write a function called `greetUser` that prompts the user to enter their name using the `prompt()` function. If the user enters a name, greet them with the message: "Hello, <name>!". If no name is provided (i.e., the user presses "Cancel" or enters an empty string), the function should use a default name "Guest" and greet them with: "Hello, Guest!".

### Requirements:
- Use a function expression.
- Ensure the function handles cases where the user cancels or leaves the input empty.
