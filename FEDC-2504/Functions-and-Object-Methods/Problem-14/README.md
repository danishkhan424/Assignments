# L1 - Validate and Calculate Discounted Price

## Problem Statement:
Write a function called `calculatePrice` that prompts the user for two inputs: price and discount. If the user doesn't provide a discount (i.e., leaves it blank), the function should apply a default discount of 10%. If the user provides an invalid price or discount (e.g., a negative number or non-numeric input), it should display an error message and prompt them to try again.

Finally, the function should calculate and return the final price after applying the discount.

### Requirements:
- Use default parameters for the discount.
- Validate both inputs to ensure they are positive numbers.
