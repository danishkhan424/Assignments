## Title
L2 - Create a Mini Student Database

## Problem Statement
Design a mini student database using an array of objects, where each object represents a student.

## Steps to Follow
1. Create an array `students` containing three student objects. Each object should have the following properties:
   - `name` (string): The student's name.
   - `age` (number): The student's age.
   - `marks` (object): An object containing scores for math, science, and English.
   
   **Example structure:**
   ```javascript
   { name: "Alice", age: 20, marks: { math: 85, science: 90, english: 88 } }
   ```
   
2. Add a new student object to the array.
3. Calculate and display the average marks for each student.
4. Print the student with the highest average marks.

## Constraints
- Use loops to iterate through the array for calculations.
- Avoid hardcoding indexes while accessing array elements.

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit your Masai Git directory link.
