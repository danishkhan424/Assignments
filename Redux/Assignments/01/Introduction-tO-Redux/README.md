By completing this assignment, you will gain a foundational understanding of Redux and its core principles.

## Detailed Explanation
### Topics
- Understanding Redux and its purpose
- Setting up Redux in a JavaScript application
- Creating actions, reducers, and the store
- Dispatching actions to update the state
- Accessing state data from the store

### Problem Statement
You are tasked with integrating Redux into a JavaScript application. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Setup Redux**: Initialize a Redux store with an initial state and a reducer function.
2. **Define Actions**: Create action types and action creators to represent different actions that can be performed in the application.
3. **Implement Reducers**: Write reducer functions to handle each action type and update the state accordingly.
4. **Dispatch Actions**: Dispatch actions to the store to trigger state updates.
5. **Access State**: Access state data from the store and display it in the application.
6. **Display Data**: Display the data in stringified format.

## Submission Guidelines
- Push your code to GitHub and share the GitHub repository link.
- Ensure that your JavaScript application runs without errors and integrates Redux as described in the problem statement.
- Include any additional observations or learnings in the README.md file of your project.
