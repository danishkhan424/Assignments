# Problem-07

#### Instructions
#### Objective: 
Create a basic React component to display a greeting message.

#### Boilerplate Code :

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Boilerplate Code</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="root"></div>
    </body>
    <script src="https://www.unpkg.com/react@18.2.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://www.unpkg.com/react-dom@18.2.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel">
        // Code goes here
    </script>
    </html>

##### Instructions:

1. Using the provided boilerplate code, create a new React component named `Greeting`.
2. This component should accept two props: `message` (a string) and `name` (also a string).
3. Render a paragraph (`<p>`) element that combines the `message` and `name` to form a greeting. For example, if `message="Hello"` and `name="Alice"`, it should display "Hello, Alice".

##### Boilerplate Code:

    <!-- Include this HTML code -->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
    <!-- ... -->
    <title>Greeting Component</title>
    <!-- ... -->
    </head>
    <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <!-- ... -->
    <script type="text/babel">
        // Your Greeting component goes here
    </script>
    </body>
    </html>

#### Notes for Students

- Remember to import React and ReactDOM at the beginning of your script.
- Make sure to capitalize your component names; this is essential in React.
- Experiment with different props and states to see how they affect the rendering of your components.
- Use the React Developer Tools browser extension to inspect your components and understand their structure and behavior.
