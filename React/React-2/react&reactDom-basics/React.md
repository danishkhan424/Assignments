#### Objective

<hr>
Learn the basics of creating user interface elements using React and ReactDOM, and compare this approach with traditional JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

#### Instructions
<hr>

1. <b>Setup:</b> Start with the provided boilerplate HTML code. This includes the necessary React and ReactDOM libraries.

2. <b>Task:</b> Your goal is to create a `<p>` element with the text "Seize the day" and display it in the DOM using React and ReactDOM. Follow these steps:

    - Create React Element: Use `React.createElement` to create a new React element. This element should be a paragraph `(<p>)` with the text "Seize the day".

    - Render with ReactDOM: Utilize ReactDOM to render your created React element inside the `<div id="root"></div>` in your HTML.

3. <b>Understand the Process:</b> As you work on this, keep in mind the differences between traditional DOM manipulation and using React. React elements are not actual DOM elements; they are lightweight descriptions that React uses to efficiently update the DOM.

#### Provided Boilerplate: 
<hr>

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>React Template</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="root"></div>
    </body>
    <script src="https://www.unpkg.com/react@18.2.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://www.unpkg.com/react-dom@18.2.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel">
        // Your task starts here
    </script>
    </html>
<hr>

#### Expected Outcome:
<hr>

Upon completion, your webpage should display a paragraph with the text "Seize the day". This demonstrates your ability to use `React` and `ReactDOM` for creating and rendering UI components.

#### Additional Notes:

- Remember, this task is about understanding the syntax and process differences between traditional JavaScript DOM manipulation and React's approach.
- Feel free to experiment with additional properties or styling to enhance your understanding.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
