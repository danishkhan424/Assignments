# Problem-06

## Instructions
#### Objective:
Develop a set of custom JSX components that interact with each other, showcasing advanced JSX syntax and Babel's transpilation process.

##### Instructions:

1. <b>Setup:</b> Begin with the provided boilerplate for your development environment.
2. <b>Custom Component Design:</b> Create at least three custom components (e.g., Header, Footer, Content), each rendering different JSX elements.
3. <b>Component Interaction:</b> Ensure these components interact with each other. For example, pass data from Header to Footer through props.
4. <b>Nested Components:</b> Demonstrate the use of nested components and how they render within parent components.
5. <b>Babel Transpilation:</b> Explore how Babel transpiles your JSX code into JavaScript. Use browser developer tools to examine the transpiled code.

##### Deliverables:

- A set of at least three custom, interacting JSX components.
- Use of advanced JSX syntax and features, with clear comments explaining each usage.
- Observations and insights on how Babel transpiles JSX into JavaScript, documented in a brief write-up.
