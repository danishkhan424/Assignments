# Problem-09

## Instructions

#### Objective: 
    
Build an interactive birthday card component that changes its message based on user input.

#### Instructions:

1. Create a component named `BirthdayCard`.
2. Use two pieces of state: one for the name of the person (`recipientName`) and another for a custom message (`customMessage`).
3. Include input fields for the user to enter the recipient's name and a custom message.
4. Render a greeting that combines these inputs, like "Happy Birthday, [name]! [message]".
5. Implement basic styling to make the card visually appealing.

##### Advanced Challenge: 
Add a feature to change the background color of the card based on the recipient's name length (e.g., a different color if the name is longer than 5 characters).

#### Notes for Students

- Remember to import React and ReactDOM at the beginning of your script.
- Make sure to capitalize your component names; this is essential in React.
- Experiment with different props and states to see how they affect the rendering of your components.
- Use the React Developer Tools browser extension to inspect your components and understand their structure and behavior.

###### Good luck and have fun with these assignments! They are designed to strengthen your understanding of React components and props, laying a solid foundation for more advanced topics in React development.
