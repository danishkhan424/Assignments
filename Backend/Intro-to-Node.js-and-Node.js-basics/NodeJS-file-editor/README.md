### **Instructions**

## **Node.js File Editor**

## **Overview**

Create a Node.js program that allows for basic file manipulation.The program should take command line arguments to specify the desired operation (command for the particular operation are given in "()" , use those commands only ):

```
Explain

 - reading ( read )
 - deleting ( delete )
 - creating ( create )
 - appending ( append )
 - rename ( rename )
 - list ( list )

```

and the file or directory to be affected. For example, running **`'node index.js read test.txt'`** should output the contents of the file **`'test.txt'`**, and **`'node index.js append test.txt CONTENT'`** should append the string **`'CONTENT'`** to the end of the file. Additionally, the program should support renaming files and listing the contents of a directory, for example, **`'node index.js rename test.txt new.txt'`** and **`'node index.js list .'`** respectively.

## **Detailed Explanation**

### **Topics**

- Taking input from terminal.
- File System Module.
- Node.js basics.

### **Setup Guidelines and Instructions**

- The code should be written in Node.js.
- Use **`process.argv`** property to retrieve the command line arguments passed to the script.
- Use **`console.log()`** to output the result of the calculation.
- Handle cases where the wrong number of arguments or invalid operations are passed.
- Add comments throughout your code to explain the logic behind each step.
- you can use any node version that works for you ( 14+ )

### **Problem Statement**

- Create a file called "test.txt" in the same directory as your Node.js program and add some text to it.
    - **`Input:`** node index.js read test.txt
    - **`Expected output:`** The contents of the file "test.txt"
- in the same "test.txt" directory as your Node.js program and add some text to it.(the new text should always be append in a new line)
    - **`Input:`** node index.js append "new content" test.txt
    - **`Expected output:`** "Content appended to the file 'test.txt'"
- Create a file called "test.txt" in the same directory as your Node.js program and add some text to it.
    - **`Input:`** node index.js delete test.txt
    - **`Expected output:`** "File 'test.txt' deleted"
- Create a file called "test.txt" in the same directory as your Node.js program
    - **`Input:`** node index.js create test.txt
    - **`Expected output:`** "File 'test.txt' created"
- Create a file called "test.txt" in the same directory as your Node.js program and add some text to it.
    - **`Input:`** node index.js rename test.txt new.txt
    - **`Expected output:`** "File 'test.txt' renamed to 'new.txt'"
- List of all files and directories in current dir
    - **`Input:`** node index.js list .
    - **`Expected output:`** A list of all files and directories in the current directory.

## **Submission Guidelines**

- Correct implementation of the mathematical operations.
- Proper handling of command line arguments.
- Proper implementation of random number generation.
- Proper handling of edge cases.
- Code readability and organization.
- Comments explaining the logic behind each step.

## **Sample Index file**

```
Explain

const path = require("path");

const operation = process.argv[2];
const file = process.argv[3];
const content = process.argv[4];

switch (operation) {
  // complete the fillowing function.

  default:
    console.log(`Invalid operation '${operation}'`);
}

```
