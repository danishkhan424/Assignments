# SQL Day-07: PSC-I Assignment
## Easy Level

#### 1. Understanding JOINS (Theoretical)
- Explain the difference between **INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN** with real-world examples.

#### 2. Customers & Orders
- Given tables:
    - **customers**(customer_id, name, email)

- Write a query to:
    - Retrieve all employees and their department names, ensuring employees without a department are still listed.
    - Find departments that have no employees.

#### 4. Filtering with Aggregation & JOIN
- Given tables:
    - **students**(student_id, name)
    - **courses**(course_id, title)
    - **enrollments**(student_id, course_id, grade)

- Write a query to:
    - Retrieve the average grade per course.
