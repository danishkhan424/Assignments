## Assignment Questions

### Easy SQL Questions (5-6 questions)
1. Calculate the total score for each student by adding the MathScore and ScienceScore.
2. Calculate the number of classes each student actually attended.
3. Find the total study hours for each student, assuming each class equals 2 study hours.
4. Calculate the average score for each student `(MathScore + ScienceScore) / 2`.
5. Retrieve the total score of each student where the combined score is greater than 160.
6. Find students who attended more than 25 classes.

### Medium Difficulty SQL Questions (4 questions)
1. Calculate the discounted price for each product and find products where the discounted price is greater than 15.
2. Find products with total inventory value (Price × Quantity) greater than 600.
3. Retrieve products where the price after discount is less than 10.
4. Find products where the price after discount is between 5 and 15.

### Hard SQL Questions (2 questions)
1. Find the student(s) who attended the maximum number of classes, and also calculate their total score.
2. Find products where the price after discount is greater than 10 but less than 20, and the total inventory value (Price × Quantity) exceeds 600.

## Submission Guidelines
- Solve the SQL queries using SQL Workbench.
- Save your work and upload your SQL file (containing all queries) to your Google Drive or any other cloud storage platform.
- Share the link to the file with permissions for viewing or editing.
- Ensure that your queries run without errors and follow the correct format.
- Submit the link to your file via the designated submission platform or to the instructor directly.
