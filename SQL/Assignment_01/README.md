# Answers:-

1. What does "relational" mean in the context of a relational database management system (RDBMS)? Explain with an example.

- **Answer:** 

    "Relational" in RDBMS refers to data stored in tables (relations) with rows and columns, linked by keys for accuracy and easy access.

    **Example: Library RDBMS**

    **Books Table:**
    | BookID | Title               | AuthorID | Year |
    |--------|----------------------|----------|------|
    | 1      | Pride and Prejudice | 1001     | 1813 |
    | 2      | 1984                | 1002     | 1949 |
    | 3      | Moby Dick           | 1003     | 1851 |

    **Authors Table:**
    | AuthorID | Name              | BirthYear |
    |----------|-------------------|-----------|
    | 1001     | Jane Austen       | 1775      |
    | 1002     | George Orwell     | 1903      |
    | 1003     | Herman Melville   | 1819      |

    Here, `AuthorID` in `Books` is a foreign key linking to `Authors`, where `AuthorID` is the primary key. This structure ensures efficient data management and retrieval.

2. Explain the role of keys in relational databases. What is the difference between a primary key and a foreign key?

- **Answer:** 

    In relational databases, **keys** are used to uniquely identify records and establish relationships between tables.

1. **Primary Key**:  
   - Uniquely identifies each record in a table.  
   - Cannot have duplicate or null values.  
   - Example: `AuthorID` in the `Authors` table.

2. **Foreign Key**:  
   - Links records between tables by referencing the primary key of another table.  
   - Ensures data integrity and establishes relationships.  
   - Example: `AuthorID` in the `Books` table references `AuthorID` in the `Authors` table.

**Difference**:  
- A **primary key** uniquely identifies a record within its table.  
- A **foreign key** references the primary key of another table to create a relationship.

3. What are the four ACID properties in databases? Explain each property with an example.

- **Answer:** 

    The **ACID properties** ensure reliable transactions in databases:

1. **Atomicity**:  
   - Ensures a transaction is treated as a single unit. It either completes entirely or not at all.  
   - **Example**: Transferring $100 from Account A to Account B. Both the debit from A and credit to B must happen, or neither does.

2. **Consistency**:  
   - Ensures the database remains in a valid state before and after a transaction.  
   - **Example**: If a transaction adds a new book to the `Books` table, the `BookID` must be unique to maintain consistency.

3. **Isolation**:  
   - Ensures concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.  
   - **Example**: If two users try to update the same book title simultaneously, one transaction waits for the other to complete.

4. **Durability**:  
   - Ensures once a transaction is committed, it remains permanent, even in case of system failure.  
   - **Example**: After saving a new author in the `Authors` table, the data persists even after a power outage.
