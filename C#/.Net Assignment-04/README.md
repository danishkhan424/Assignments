# C# Looping Constructs Assignment

## Instructions
Answer the following questions to the best of your ability. Provide code examples where necessary. Submit your answers in a document or as a code file.

## Section 1: Basic Questions

1. What are the different types of loops in C#?
2. Explain the syntax and working of the for loop in C#.
3. How does a while loop work?
4. What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?
5. What happens if the loop condition in a while loop is initially false?
6. How do you use a foreach loop in C#?
7. Can we modify elements inside a foreach loop? Why or why not?

## Section 2: Intermediate Questions

1. What is an infinite loop? Provide examples using for, while, and do-while.
2. How does the break statement work inside loops?
3. What is the role of the continue statement in loops?
4. How can you exit multiple nested loops at once?
5. What is the difference between break and return inside a loop?
6. How do you iterate through an array using loops?
7. Write a C# program to find the largest and smallest number in an array using loops.

## Section 3: Advanced Questions

1. Can a for loop run indefinitely? If yes, how?
2. How do you implement a loop using recursion instead of traditional looping constructs?
3. What is the impact of using goto inside loops? Is it recommended? Explain with an example.
4. How does a foreach loop work internally in C#?
5. Can a foreach loop be replaced with a for loop? If yes, in what cases?
6. How do you optimize performance in loops when working with large datasets?
7. What are the best practices for writing efficient loops in C#?
8. How does the Parallel.ForEach loop differ from a normal foreach loop? Provide an example.

## Bonus Challenge

Write a C# program that processes a list of tasks using both normal foreach and Parallel.ForEach loops. Compare and explain the output. How does parallel processing improve performance in this scenario?

## Submission Guidelines

Submit your code files and answers in a well-structured document. Push the files to a GitHub repo and submit the link.
